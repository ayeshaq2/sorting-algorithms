# sorting-algorithms
This project is part of a lab assignment for my course SE2205: Data Structures and Algorithms, prepared and assigned by Professor Quazi Mehbubar Rehman.

For this assignment, the main objective was to be able to write out some different sorting algorithms and compare their sorting times given an equal data set to each. 
We used the algorithms bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, mergesort, quick sort (with inplace partitioning) and radix sort.
